                <b>Indian Premier League (IPL)</b>, Indian professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league established in 2008. 
                The league, which is based on a round-robin group and knockout format, has teams in major Indian cities.

The brainchild of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI),
 the IPL has developed into the most lucrative and most popular outlet for the game of cricket. 
 Matches generally begin in late afternoon or evening so that at least a portion of them are played under floodlights at night to maximize the television audience for worldwide broadcasts.
  Initially, league matches were played on a home-and-away basis between all teams, but, with the planned expansion to 10 clubs (divided into two groups of five) in 2011, that format changed so that matches between some teams would be limited to a single encounter. The top four teams contest three play-off matches, with one losing team being given a second chance to reach the final, a wrinkle aimed at maximizing potential television revenue. The play-off portion of the tournament involves the four teams that finished at the top of the tables in a series of knockout games that allows one team that lost its first-round game a second chance to advance to the final match.

                <h2> Rules and History</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/94/215094-138-43F24228/Cricket-worlds-most-popular-sport-the-Timeless-Test-how-to-play-scoring-modernization.jpg?w=800&h=450&c=crop">
            <p>
                The basic rules are the same as for the longer versions, but innings are limited to 20 overs a side (an over comprises six balls delivered,
                 or thrown, by a bowler to a batsman at the opposite wicket), 
                 with a maximum of four overs for each bowler and restrictions on the placement of fielders designed to encourage big hitting by the batsmen and high scores.
                  In a short time, T20 became the most popular and lucrative form of cricket, particularly in India, where huge crowds attend matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and millions more watch on television. A shortened form of cricket known as Cricket Max was developed in New Zealand in the 1990s by the former Test batsman Martin Crowe,
                   but the official rules for T20 were established by the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the first tournament was played by the English county teams, in 2003.
